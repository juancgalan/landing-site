My name is Juan Carlos Galan Hernandez and I'm a Software Developer,
Video Game Designer and Scientific Writer. 

Right now, I'm a Computer Sciences teacher at UDLAP and Digital Animation 
teacher at Tec de Monterrey. Prior becoming a teacher, I was a Software 
Developer focused on Java and Cloud Computing.

Working on cloud based projects and reading about programming language design
are two of my favorite subjects on software development. I also enjoy working
on video game design. I'm passionate about my career and I love to write
about different subjects related to my research.

Below you can find links to my past publications and a showcase of my
work on animation and video games (to be added later). You can also find a blog
where I write about different subjects on programming and art.
